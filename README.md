## HOOMD-Organics
HOOMD-Organics is a modular “wrapper” package for molecular dynamics (MD)
simulation pipeline development, designed to enable fast, reproducible,
end-to- end simulation workflows with minimal user effort. This package is a
wrapper for [MoSDeF](https://github.com/mosdef-hub) packages and
[Hoomd-Blue](https://github.com/glotzerlab/hoomd-blue) with a focus on
simulating soft matter systems.

An object-oriented design makes HOOMD-Organics extensible and highly flexible.
This is bolstered by a library-based approach to system initialization, making
HOOMD-Organics agnostic to system identity, forcefield, and thermodynamic
ensemble, and allowing for growth on an as-needed basis.



## Installation
